hello

basically open main.m and run it (make sure you have all the other function files with it)

you can change the size of the matrix you want

vector spacing is how 'noisy' the eventual output will be



stuff i will do in a bit:

use the b14 thing to match the distribution of intensities in the map to reflect real thickness distribution in the arctic (I have the data, just need to do the maths)

discrete-ise the map to match sea ice index values

output matrix into a text file or a .dat file or something so that people using python or whatever can use it
